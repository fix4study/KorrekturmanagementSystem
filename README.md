# Correction Management System for Learning Materials

This repository contains a prototype of a Correction Management System developed as part of a study project at IU (Internationale Hochschule). The system is designed to support the management of corrections and improvements for various didactic materials used in distance learning, such as scripts, solution booklets, myCampus questions, vodcasts, tutorials, literature references, and more.

## Status

:construction: **This project is currently under active development. Features and documentation may change.**

## Project Goal

The main objective is to analyze, design, and implement a prototype system that enables:

- **Quick and easy reporting** of errors, suggestions, and additions by all relevant stakeholders.
- **Centralized collection, categorization, assignment, and evaluation** of all reports.
- **Traceability** of each report throughout its lifecycle, from submission to implementation or rejection.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for submitting error reports and suggestions.
- Categorization and prioritization of reports.
- Assignment of reports to responsible persons or teams.
- Status tracking for each report (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved, Rejected).
- Overview and filtering of all reports for efficient management.

## Technology Stack

- .NET 9
- Blazor
- Entity Framework Core
- **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)**
- **Azure App Service** (for hosting)
- **Azure Blob Storage** (for file storage)

**Developed as part of the IU study project: "Analysis, Design, and Prototypical Implementation of a Correction Management System".**
